  - Current version uses in-memory storage  
  - Can be extended to CSV or database integration  

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Language: **Java**  
- Style: **Single-file implementation** (easy to run and understand)  
- Approach: Mix of structured coding and *vibe coding* experimentation  

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gyanankur23/Library-Management-System-Java-
   cd Library-Management-System-Java-
